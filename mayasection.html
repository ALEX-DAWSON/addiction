      <h2>Drug Symptoms</h2>
      <h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
      <p>
        One of the main things that people struggle with is depression and anxiety. This normally increases when you become addicted to drugs and or already struggle with an addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are lots of symptoms after or when your are addicted to drugs, some of which are worse than others. I'm going to list a few of the symptoms and go into depth the few I list. You could possibly come across increased depression or irritability, changes in attitude or personality and even increased urges or involvement with criminal activity. This all can affect the way that person thinks and feels in general. There are many ways to start to help some of which are listed in some of our previous articles. Depression is extremely difficult to manage on your own and when it increases it can become even more hard to see that you need help and it's there.Here is a quote from the website www.drugabuse.com it states that “Drug use tends to significantly alter a person's behavior and habits. Some drugs can impair the brain's ability to focus and think clearly”. This statement itself proves that drugs affect you and your brain drastically . There's more they also state that “Drug abuse affects people from all walks of life and all socioeconomic statuses. Whatever the reason a person starts taking drugs, whether recreationally or as prescribed, tolerance and dependence may develop for some people—sometimes before the user even realizes it”.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion there are so many symptoms that drug users should look for to see the signs of addiction.If you are a drug user be safe, maybe see a therapist and dont doubt your ability to stop the addiction. You are one hundred percent capable of stopping the addiction and overcoming the fear that goes along with it!

      <h2>Drug Side Effects</h2>
      <h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
      <p>
        There are many side effects to using drugs, especially when you are continuously using them. There's always a way out no matter what you think, there is.You may think you are incapable of doing it or its impossible but look at all the things you have done. There has to be one thing you are proud of or that you have accomplished in your life. Whether you are 14 or 45 there are many things, small things I can think of that I'm proud of . For instance, I am very proud of my capability to be social and speak with others with respect (most of the time). See now if you can just take a minute and appreciate your strengths other than your weaknesses then maybe you can see that an addiction is not all of you. An addicition is just a part of you it does not define you. It is also something that not just you struggle with. Side effects all differ depending on the person there is a possibility you can get headaches and another person won't. Considering they all have their own side effects you should take the time to get to know them. Like for instance meth meth is a drug that has too many side effects to count a few of which are:Hallucinations, hyperexcitability, irritability, Panic and psychosis, Convulsions, seizures and death from high doses. These all are very serious side effects .If you think that these things are not serious and wont change your life ,then take the time to research about how these negative experiences with drugs can change you for a whole lifetime. Not nessecarily just you but your loved ones and others surrounding you can be impacted through your journey as well. This means that while you think your the one being impacted because your taking the drugs take a step back and see (one who does harm to themsleves always does harm to one or more in the process). Whether it’s your mom, grandad or even a not well known person it still has a mental impact or physical impact on them. Dont be alone find yourself and dont hesitate to get help and ask questions during this process.
