				<h2>Prescription Drugs</h2>
				<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
				<p>
					The average person may prescribed 14,000 pills (this doesn't even include over the counter meds.) By the time you reach your 70s you could be taking five or more pills everyday. Many people assume that the medication they are taking are exerting carefully designed effects on their biological functions. In reality theses effects were not designed but rather observed. Before taking a medication it is important to assess whether the short and long term risks outweigh the benefits and 	whether are less toxic non drug alternatives available. Prescription drug is taking the drug as it was not intended to be taken. This also includes taking the drug without a prescription. Someone taking someone else's prescription drug experience a high or other effects the drug might have. Studies have shown that it's easy for abusers to get prescription for unneeded drugs. With research people can get a false positive diagnosis for things such as ADHD which is treated with prescription stimulants. The average age when prescription drugs abuse starts is around 21. So if abusers are in college with a prescription they will most likely be doing it and other people will be trying to get it off them.

				<p>
					Legalizing cannabis would generate 8.7 billion in fedral and start tax revenue per year. The membranes of certain nerve cells in the brain contain receptors the baind to THC kicking off a series of cellular reaction that ultimately lead to the high that people expreience when they are using marigana. People use the drug becuase it elevates their mood and relaxes them. And it brings their stress leave down. Depending on the leave of THC users may also experience evphoria hallucinations and paranoia. Some of the common discomforls found when using marijana include dry mouth, swollen eyelids, bloodshot eyes , loss of coordindioxid and acelerated heat rate.There no meducation to direcly reat marijunna abuse. Most abusers seeking profferssinal treatment receive behaviord treatment in either group of individual session or both. The effects of recreational cannabis used is include being lightheaded and a feeling of relaxtion increadsed appetite and reduced blood pressure. There are some evidence that marijanna or some of its components such as CBD may be useful for reliving server pain, inflammation, navsea and chromic conditions.

				<h2>Alcohol</h2>
				<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
				<p>
					Alcohol is the most commmonly used addicted drug . Each year about 5000 teens die from a result of underage drinking, 1,600 as a result of homicides, 300 from suicide, 1,900 deaths from motor vehicle crashes and hundreds of induries. Teens are more likely to abuse or become addicted to alcohol because their brains are less developed. In the use there are 1.5 million casual drinkers, 2 million heavy drinkers and 6.5 million Binge Drinkers. 17.6 million people or one in every 12 adults.
				</p>
				<h2>Tobacco</h2>
				<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
				<p>
					Tobacco takes about 10 years off a smoker's life. Cigarette smoke contains 7000 chemicals and 70 of the chemicals can cause cancer. Around 9 out of 10 smokers started smoking before the age of 18 and almost every other smoker started before the age 26. Smoking and tobacco use causes more than 5 million deaths per year worldwide. Current trends show that this will increase to more than 8 million deaths annually by 2030.
				</p>
				<h2>Opioids</h2>
				<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
				<p>
					Opioids are a prescription drug that are used for pain relief. opioids are natural and are naturally found in opioid poppy plant`s. When prescribed, opioids are a very good relief for pain. However, some people take the prescribed opioids to get high. Some prescribed opioids are oxycodone (OxyContin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), codeine, and morphine. Some slang terms are Oxy,Percs, and Vikes. Some other opioids that are for non-medical use includes fentanyl and heroin. Heroin is made out of morphine which is made out of opium poppy plants. Heroin is grown in Southeast and Southwest Asia, Mexico, and Colombia, it can be a brown or white powder or a black sticky substance that is known as black tar and some other names for heroin are big H, horse, hell dust, and smack. This substance is injected, snorted and smoked. Fentanyl is a prescription drug that can only be taken in small doses. When opioids are misused they can be very harmful. It can slow your breathing and could end up in a fatal overdose.

				<h2>Amphetamines</h2>
				<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
				<p>
					Did you know that the number of people dying from an amphetamine addiction has increased by 30% between 2016 and 2017. It is proven that Amphetamines are extremely hard on the body , causing high blood pressure and heart and lung disease. This drug use of amphetamines can have life changing effects (permanent damage) . Amphetamine usage was at one point higher than opioid use, high doses may cause violence,seizures,stroke and even a coma! It can also be snorted, injected and or eaten.
					In the 1930’s this drug was used as an inhaler and you could buy it over the counter without ID. This was when professionals claimed there was no risk for addiction. This drug is soluble in water and is a nervous system stimulant, discovered in 1887. It exists as 2 types of Amphetamines, one of which is levoamphetamine and the other is Dextroamphetamine. In conclusion, this is an extremely strong drug which can have a permanent effect on certain parts of your body.
				</p>
				<h2>Hallucinogens</h2>
				<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
				<p>
					LSD produces some tolerance to other hallucinogens including psilocybin. This is one of the quotes that an Analytical Chemist stated. Now we are onto types of Hallucinogens include the following: (DMT, Ketamine, Mescaline, Bath Salts, etc .) Some of these drugs will produce short term and long term effects. Some of these short term effects include: heart rate, nausea, memory loss and even intensified feelings and sensory. The long term effects can get extremely complicated, some of which are : sexual behaviour, sensory perception, sleep and even muscle control . One of the main long term effects that caught my eye was “ Spiritual Experiences”  This specific side effect can be seen in less than 1 minute and lasts less than 30 minutes. Some more of the side effects that stood out to me was weight loss, Anxiety, depression suicidal, memory loss and even flashbacks . I’m sure most teens can sympathize with a feeling of anxiety whether its before a big talent show or even before a job interview or meeting . This feeling can be extremely overwhelming and can have an impact on your entire day if it is bad enough can make you feel extremely lonely . When you are lonely it can result in hibernation and isolation which is also a side effect to this drug.
				</p>
				<h2>Inhalants</h2>
				<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
				<p>
					There are 4 types of inhalants: Degreasers, Gasoline , Glues and White-out/ felt tip markers. A quote I found stated that “ inhalants are gases that produce a high when breathed or inhaled in. Of course the manufacturers intent was not for the product to be inhaled but it is still going to happen especially someone who is addicted in the first place . More than 1000 other common household objects or regular items can be used as inhalants . Some of their street names include the following: Hiagra in a bottle,Shoot the breeze and even Toilet water. This drug can give you many side effects here is a quote I found stating them. “Long-Term Effects of Inhalants. Like many drugs, inhalant abuse can result in death, and it doesn't have to be long-term abuse that causes it. Sudden sniffing death can occur even after just one use - volatile compounds cross from the lungs into the bloodstream, and can lead to: Loss of consciousness”. An inhalant high can last 45 minutes and can start immediately. I also think most teens have experienced a thought about what “ high” feels like… whether you have tried it or not it still is a though that has crossed your mind . In conclusion this drug has some very extreme and permanent consequences like death. Advice: If addicted GET HELP  and if your thinking about trying it think about the pros and cons of trying the drug .Think about the consequences of how it will end.
