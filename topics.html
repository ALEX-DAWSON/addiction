				<h2>What are some benefits of your child going to rehab?</h2>
				<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
				<p>
					 I feel as though going to rehab will help your child have a better and happy life. When your child is suffering everyday, Your child will end up getting help from people that know what they are doing. Once your child is off all the drugs that they are doing they will feel a lot better about themselves and they will know what is going on in the moment that they are in. Some parents wonder why these things are happening to their child. Some peoples kids tend to struggle with depression during their teen years. Most kids will go to drugs to cover up their depression. Or they will do drugs because that's the way of feeling okay and safe. Some signs of depression are according to “WebMD” feeling guilt, worthless, loss of interest in doing things, not wanting to be around people, loss of remembering things, loss of sleep or sleeping too much.

				<h2>Can other drug addictions lead to other mental health disorders? </h2>
				<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
				<p>	Its abnormal for an addicted person to have other mental illnesses but it is unidentified weather the Mental health is caused by the addiction or not. It is also common that some genes in your family could contribute to the addiction. According to BBR foundation  “several studies show that in some cases marijuana and other drugs can produce psychotic symptoms similar to those experienced by people with schizophrenia.” Heavy use of drugs can lead to both long term and short term effects. People who are addicted to drugs can experience depression, anxiety and aggressive behaviors. Some of the top drugs that cause mental health problems are marijuana, cocaine and kratom. If your unaware, Kratom is a drug that alters your sense of reality and makes you think that things are real when they’re not.
