				<h2>What are some benefits of your child going to rehab?</h2>
				<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
				<p>
					I feel as though going to rehab will help your child have a better and happy life. When your child is suffering everyday, Your child will end up getting help from people that know what they are doing. Once your child is off all the drugs that they are doing they will feel a lot better about themselves and they will know what is going on in the moment that they are in. Some parents wonder why these things are happening to their child. Some peoples kids tend to struggle with depression during their teen years. Most kids will go to drugs to cover up their depression. Or they will do drugs because that's the way of feeling okay and safe. Some signs of depression are according to “WebMD” feeling guilt, worthless, loss of interest in doing things, not wanting to be around people, loss of remembering things, loss of sleep or sleeping too much.
				</p>
				<h2>Can other drug addictions lead to other mental health disorders? </h2>
				<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
				<p>	Its abnormal for an addicted person to have other mental illnesses but it is unidentified weather the Mental health is caused by the addiction or not. It is also common that some genes in your family could contribute to the addiction. According to BBR foundation  “several studies show that in some cases marijuana and other drugs can produce psychotic symptoms similar to those experienced by people with schizophrenia.” Heavy use of drugs can lead to both long term and short term effects. People who are addicted to drugs can experience depression, anxiety and aggressive behaviors. Some of the top drugs that cause mental health problems are marijuana, cocaine and kratom. If your unaware, Kratom is a drug that alters your sense of reality and makes you think that things are real when they’re not.
				</p>
				<h2>How do I get my kid to go to rehab?</h2>
				<h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
				<p>
					Some positive things you can do to get your child to go to rehab could be telling them what will happen if they don’t go. For example, many people that don't go to get help could end up in jail, on the streets, and/or overdosing.
					I think if the person with the addiction talked to people that are in jail about their past and what they had to go through because of their addiction, then the person may not want to do the drug because they don't want their life to be like that. You could also tell them the benefits of going to rehab and encourage them to make the right choice.
					Another good thing you could do is get your child to talk to someone that has already been through an addiction that hasn't been in trouble with the law. That way, they can see what they may have to go through in the future if they don't go to rehab and get help, even if they didn't end up in jail.
				</p>
				<h2>What do I do if my child goes into the stage of denial?</h2>
				<h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
				<p>
					If your child doesn't think they have a problem and or doesn't think they need help, these are some things you can do.
					One thing that may be very effective is having a family meeting so everyone of the child's loved ones can tell them how they feel and why they feel that way. They can talk about how they might lose them to the child's use of drugs.
					The second thing that could help them stop or make them stop is telling them that if they don't get help they may have to move out.
					The last suggestion I have for you could be being very up front with them and brutally honest about the addiction and how much it is going to ruin their life. Say if they are going to continue using the drug that they are going to lose everyone because they don't want to see them going through that. Also tell the person if they are going to anyway, then everyone is going to be there to help the child get over the addiction.

				<h2>What are some in home skills I can teach my child to cope better?</h2>
				<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
				<p>
					You can learn to cope with the addictions and difficult emotions to manage. This can help you only if you let it. One of the core skills is Wise Mind. This skill teaches you to be in the moment and understand the consequences of your actions. Sometimes this skill may seem
					stupid or unworthy of your time due to the time it takes to be able to do it independently. To be completely honest, you’re never going to be “perfect”, but who is right? This skill falls under a program specified for mental health called “DBT”. “Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a specific type of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy developed in the late 1980s by psychologist Marsha M. Linehan to help better treat borderline personality disorder. Since its development, it has also been used for the treatment of other kinds of mental health disorders”.
				</p>
				<h2>What options of treatment options are there for my child?</h2>
				<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
				<p>
					Now people cannot tell you to send your kid away immediately, because you and your kid could have a strong bond. Instead what I can tell you is discussing some options, like rehab, with the child with the addiction will benefit you highly. This will benefit you because the child probably right now has to many worries present at the moment and if you send them to rehab without consulting them they could become aggressive and refuse to go . There are multiple alternatives if you and your loved one is unwilling to compromise with rehab. There are 26 programs for youth in Ontario.

			<h1>What Has a Positive Impact on Drug Users?</h1>
			<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			<p>
				First off you first need to start by getting there consent for whatever your doing with them. Then you should sit them down to brainstorm ideas for your start of the journey of positive impact. Some things that may have a negative impact are taking their drugs away completely and being harsh or yelling at them. Discipline is helpful but you would need to lean them off of the drug and not completely confiscate the drug or things could become negative and could damage the relationship. There are many ways to start to become a positive role model for the drug user, like staying away from drugs yourself or relating their situation to a similar one of your own. It could be in past tense or could be in present tense, but try not to relate it to anything that could make the person become emotional.
				There are many ways to becoming confident and being emotionally stable. Some of which are meditating, deep breathing and trying to push other people's judgements aside. You can start by going into the conversation with an open mind and not judging the other person for their ideas . They may say things you don't agree with but again don't shut them down ,consider it and try to incorporate their ideas into your own. Ideas they may have for stopping the addiction and or what they think has a positive impact of them all vary due to individual needs. So one person might need something like a teddy bear to cuddle and others may need the drug taken away and handle the withdrawal symptoms.
			</p>
			<h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
			<p>
				Some things that will have a positive impact on other drug user or ex-drug users could be keeping them distracted and trying to do more things. Even going for walks could have a positive impact because it keeps them distracted. Also not leaving the person alone because that could make them think about it and then they may end up going back in the drugs.
				Some other things you could do for the person is trying to get them into a good hobby. For example, you could get them into an art class, a book club, or help them get back any friends that may have left them during their addiction. I wouldn't suggest any sports because that would be a lot for someone to handle when going through addiction recovery. Aswell, a lot of people that are drug users aren't very active.
				Lastly, I think that a positive thing for the person with an addiction is keeping them away from stress or anything that will make them think about the drug. Keep them away from anyone that does drugs or has any access to the drug because then the person will end up getting addicted to that drug again. If that happens, then you will have to start over with recovery from the person's addiction.

			<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>

				To start off you need to make the biggest descion of the whole journey. Are you willing to support your loved one all of the times theyll need you?Remember that you make the descion about your addiction. An addiction is not a choice or something you have a choice over...it is a disease of the brain. An addiction is mainly a condition that the person must learn to manage with as amuch support as they can get ; no one can take the fight on for the addict.Set boundaries and stand by them throughout the whole journer .Encourage the person to seek help; this may include finding treatment resources for them.Find a therapist who specializes in addiction counseling and get help. Loved ones of addicts need support too because they have alot on their plate managing this by yourself is not easy.
				They may ask you for out of the ordinary things like maybe fast foods or snacks to fill the craving for the drug. If you are willing to commit to being there for them and cataring to their needs then by all means go ahead and get them the things that they need. Sometimes when a craving becomes to strong it can overcome the love and affection that they have for you and they can become agressive. Another thing you could do to make them comfortable in their own skin is trying to encorporate some source of activity planner so that they know what to do during the day and when.
				In conclusion drugs affect opeople in different ways and can change your relationship with them durastically the best thing to do is to start small and work your way up. This may seem hard at first but once you realize their worth it it gets alot easier for the both of you. Try harder, support and become the best role model that perosn has ever had .

			<h1>Should laws change around drug abuse?</h1>
			<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
			<p>
				One commonly asked question is should drug abuse laws be changed? I think they should be changed because a lot of people are overdosing and they are abusing drugs and then a lot of people are dying because of it. A lot of families and friends are losing their loved one because of it and that's not fair to them and plus people are using drugs for wrong reasons. I'm not saying there is a right reason anyone should be using drugs. Some people are using drugs for their depression or anxiety or just because things at home are not going the way they want it to be going.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think if the laws would change then i really think there could be less of people losing their loved ones and less people overdosing and less people trying to hurt themselves. I think if they changed the laws of drug abuse then a lot of people would feel more safe and more people would think of not doing drugs to hurt themselves because they might find a better way of fixing their problems. They could always go and find someone to talk to or they might have a favorite food that they like and they might turn to that if they are feeling like they are going down hill. I think this could really benefit them and the people around them.
			</p>
			<p>
				 Some other reasons why I think that it would be a good idea of changing the drug abuse laws is because some people have a really hard time getting off the drugs and if there are laws about it then people around the people that are doing drugs will try and help them and try and figure out something better to do in their spare time. I think this will help a lot of people in the long run and people will feel a lot better about themselves and people will stop losing their loved ones.

			 <h3> Maya Kalan-McPhee </h3>
			 <p>
				 There are so many things people constantly wonder about the judgement of the people who enforce and place laws.Many questions are asked one of them being should the laws be changed on drug distribution and drug abuse? So here we go.
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 There are many different charges that can be placed when drug abuse and drug distrubution comes into play. Drug Trafficking: “The punishment for drug trafficking can vary widely depending on several factors including the type and quantity of drugs involved, the type of drugs, geographic area of distribution, and whether children were targeted. Sentences for drug distribution and trafficking can generally range from 3-5 years to life in prison, but can be substantially higher when larger quantities are involved.”<a href="sources.html"><sup>2</sup></a>
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 In all seriousness this is not something to take lightly this is a serious issue that is common throughout our society. Aagin a question that is asked commonly is should the laws be changed? Now normally a large chunk of people would say yes.But a large amount of people are saying no. They  feel that the laws for drug abuse and distribution should stay put and or even be raised for the charges. That may seem harsh but it's accurate. Imagine your son or daughter or a loved one, distributing illegal drugs. Would you want it to be taken lightly? Especiaslly if it's a serious offense?

				 “Even the most habitual behaviour can be changed with the right addiction treatment centre. Through advancements in science and brain imaging, we know that the brain can be re-wired and new neural pathways can be developed. With the right treatment, the chains of addiction can be broken.
				 The Canadian Health Recovery Centre is a private addiction treatment centre set on 14 wooded acres, designed exclusively to care for men with substance abuse and dependence problems.

			 <p>
				 In conclusion Drug laws should be changed or raised after reasearching further into the topic.

			 <h1>What does peer pressure look like?</h1>
			 <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
			 <p>
				 Peer  pressure would look like for me is someone wanting me to do something and I would keep on sayiong no no but then i would say yes because the prison would keep on asking and then I would keep on feeling bad if I kept on saying no to them. The reason why I would do this is because when people ask me to do something and I say no then I feel bad after so i would then change my mind and say yes. Even though that could be bad for someone it do it's something that someone like me can’t help but do it. Or I would start crying to make them feel bad and then maybe they would stop asking. If that doesn’t work then I would give in and just say yes to them.
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 But some ways I have been doing to make that stop is if someone asks me to do something and if I say no and then they ask again I will walk away and if they follow me i still start running and i will go get someone to help me. The reason why someone should do that is because you never know what is in that drug that someone could be asking you to do. It could be laced with something and you could get really hurt by it or you could die from it as well. Someone should never give in and do something that you don’t want to do even if it's the hardest thing of your life that you are doing someone is always going to come up to you and get you to do something you don’t really wanna do. But there is always something you can it top fix that you just gotta stay with what your gut tells you and things will be okay.

				 “Peer pressure from children’s friends in school can have a high impact on decisions they make. Friends play a significant role in how your child makes decisions. When your child hangs out with kids who do certain things, the tendency for your child to join in greatly increases. A study done by Columbia University found that a child is six times more likely to have an alcoholic drink if they have friends who drink” In many cases, children and teens feel an intense pressure to fit in. They will behave and make decisions based on what they think their peers want them to do. If your child thinks that taking drugs or drinking alcohol will raise the respect their peers have for them, there’s a good chance she or he will try it at least once.”<a href="sources.html"><sup>12</sup></a>

			 <h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			 <p>
				 Uwsusally when you feel obligated to say or do something ultimatley you have control over it. You have the last and final call. Remember that throughtout all of your experiences your the ruler of descion making. Some common topics of peer pressure are: Drugs/Alcohol, Negative Body Image, and lastly the way your seen. The way your seen is a huge topic alot of people struggle with. Sometimes you can be pressured to not only change the way you look but change the way your are around others. You can easily bre pressurted to do things your uncomfortable with and be pressured to change the true you. Dont let others try to make you more like them ause there's only one of every one of us. My names maya there cannot be somone whos identical and acts exactly the sameway as me. You are unique in your own way. Stay that way. There is one thing you could  get peer pressured to do that could have a positive impact on your life. For instance if you are struggling to get out and enjoy life and you are failing to be social and ge tfresh air. Then yes, maybe the pressure isn't such a bad thing due to the inibility to be social and egt fresh air. Now be prepared for your part to peer prssure saying “NO”. You need to stand up for yourself and be there in the present moment instead of backing down and saying nothing at all.There is nothing wrong with being yourself and standing up for your rights. Infroming the bully youare who you are and you love yourself and moving on with your day. Dont fight back just say somehting nice or ignore it completley. In conclusion, peer pressure can be difficult to manage along and if you are thinking of fighting back take a minute and be grateful,think before you speak.

Our team of skilled clinicians and specialists deal expressly with the complexities of restoring the mind, body and spirit with a program that promotes recovery on several pivotal levels: biochemical, neurological, psychological, emotional, physical, nutritional and spiritual.We treat drug and alcohol dependency and behavioural addictions, including concurrent mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, without prescribing psychotropic drugs.We will help you throw away the guilt and anxiety, and we will address the fear, misconceptions and limiting beliefs that surround chemical dependency and prevent true and lasting recovery.” <a href="sources.html"><sup>2</sup></a>
