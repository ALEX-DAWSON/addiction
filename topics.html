				<h2>What are some benefits of your child going to rehab?</h2>
				<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
				<p>
					I feel as though going to rehab will help your child have a better and happy life. When your child is suffering everyday, Your child will end up getting help from people that know what they are doing. Once your child is off all the drugs that they are doing they will feel a lot better about themselves and they will know what is going on in the moment that they are in. Some parents wonder why these things are happening to their child. Some peoples kids tend to struggle with depression during their teen years. Most kids will go to drugs to cover up their depression. Or they will do drugs because that's the way of feeling okay and safe. Some signs of depression are according to “WebMD” feeling guilt, worthless, loss of interest in doing things, not wanting to be around people, loss of remembering things, loss of sleep or sleeping too much.

				<h2>Can other drug addictions lead to other mental health disorders? </h2>
				<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
				<p>	Its abnormal for an addicted person to have other mental illnesses but it is unidentified weather the Mental health is caused by the addiction or not. It is also common that some genes in your family could contribute to the addiction. According to BBR foundation  “several studies show that in some cases marijuana and other drugs can produce psychotic symptoms similar to those experienced by people with schizophrenia.” Heavy use of drugs can lead to both long term and short term effects. People who are addicted to drugs can experience depression, anxiety and aggressive behaviors. Some of the top drugs that cause mental health problems are marijuana, cocaine and kratom. If your unaware, Kratom is a drug that alters your sense of reality and makes you think that things are real when they’re not.

				<h2>How do I get my kid to go to rehab?</h2>
				<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
				<p>
					Some positive things you can do to get your child to go to rehab could be telling them what will happen if they don’t go. For example, many people that don't go to get help could end up in jail, on the streets, and/or overdosing.
					I think if the person with the addiction talked to people that are in jail about their past and what they had to go through because of their addiction, then the person may not want to do the drug because they don't want their life to be like that. You could also tell them the benefits of going to rehab and encourage them to make the right choice.
					Another good thing you could do is get your child to talk to someone that has already been through an addiction that hasn't been in trouble with the law. That way, they can see what they may have to go through in the future if they don't go to rehab and get help, even if they didn't end up in jail.

				<h2>What do I do if my child goes into the stage of denial?</h2>
				<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
				<p>
					If your child doesn't think they have a problem and or doesn't think they need help, these are some things you can do.
					One thing that may be very effective is having a family meeting so everyone of the child's loved ones can tell them how they feel and why they feel that way. They can talk about how they might lose them to the child's use of drugs.
					The second thing that could help them stop or make them stop is telling them that if they don't get help they may have to move out.
					The last suggestion I have for you could be being very up front with them and brutally honest about the addiction and how much it is going to ruin their life. Say if they are going to continue using the drug that they are going to lose everyone because they don't want to see them going through that. Also tell the person if they are going to anyway, then everyone is going to be there to help the child get over the addiction.

				<h2>What are some in home skills I can teach my child to cope better?</h2>
				<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
				<p>
					You can learn to cope with the addictions and difficult emotions to manage. This can help you only if you let it. One of the core skills is Wise Mind. This skill teaches you to be in the moment and understand the consequences of your actions. Sometimes this skill may seem
					stupid or unworthy of your time due to the time it takes to be able to do it independently. To be completely honest, you’re never going to be “perfect”, but who is right? This skill falls under a program specified for mental health called “DBT”. “Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a specific type of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy developed in the late 1980s by psychologist Marsha M. Linehan to help better treat borderline personality disorder. Since its development, it has also been used for the treatment of other kinds of mental health disorders”.

				<h2>What options of treatment options are there for my child?</h2>
				<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
				<p>
					Now people cannot tell you to send your kid away immediately, because you and your kid could have a strong bond. Instead what I can tell you is discussing some options, like rehab, with the child with the addiction will benefit you highly. This will benefit you because the child probably right now has to many worries present at the moment and if you send them to rehab without consulting them they could become aggressive and refuse to go . There are multiple alternatives if you and your loved one is unwilling to compromise with rehab. There are 26 programs for youth in Ontario.

			<h1>What Has a Positive Impact on Drug Users?</h1>
			<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			<p>
				First off you first need to start by getting there consent for whatever your doing with them. Then you should sit them down to brainstorm ideas for your start of the journey of positive impact. Some things that may have a negative impact are taking their drugs away completely and being harsh or yelling at them. Discipline is helpful but you would need to lean them off of the drug and not completely confiscate the drug or things could become negative and could damage the relationship. There are many ways to start to become a positive role model for the drug user, like staying away from drugs yourself or relating their situation to a similar one of your own. It could be in past tense or could be in present tense, but try not to relate it to anything that could make the person become emotional.
				There are many ways to becoming confident and being emotionally stable. Some of which are meditating, deep breathing and trying to push other people's judgements aside. You can start by going into the conversation with an open mind and not judging the other person for their ideas . They may say things you don't agree with but again don't shut them down ,consider it and try to incorporate their ideas into your own. Ideas they may have for stopping the addiction and or what they think has a positive impact of them all vary due to individual needs. So one person might need something like a teddy bear to cuddle and others may need the drug taken away and handle the withdrawal symptoms.

			<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
			<p>
				Some things that will have a positive impact on other drug user or ex-drug users could be keeping them distracted and trying to do more things. Even going for walks could have a positive impact because it keeps them distracted. Also not leaving the person alone because that could make them think about it and then they may end up going back in the drugs.
				Some other things you could do for the person is trying to get them into a good hobby. For example, you could get them into an art class, a book club, or help them get back any friends that may have left them during their addiction. I wouldn't suggest any sports because that would be a lot for someone to handle when going through addiction recovery. Aswell, a lot of people that are drug users aren't very active.
				Lastly, I think that a positive thing for the person with an addiction is keeping them away from stress or anything that will make them think about the drug. Keep them away from anyone that does drugs or has any access to the drug because then the person will end up getting addicted to that drug again. If that happens, then you will have to start over with recovery from the person's addiction.

				To start off you need to make the biggest descion of the whole journey. Are you willing to support your loved one all of the times theyll need you?Remember that you make the descion about your addiction. An addiction is not a choice or something you have a choice over...it is a disease of the brain. An addiction is mainly a condition that the person must learn to manage with as amuch support as they can get ; no one can take the fight on for the addict.Set boundaries and stand by them throughout the whole journer .Encourage the person to seek help; this may include finding treatment resources for them.Find a therapist who specializes in addiction counseling and get help. Loved ones of addicts need support too because they have alot on their plate managing this by yourself is not easy.
				They may ask you for out of the ordinary things like maybe fast foods or snacks to fill the craving for the drug. If you are willing to commit to being there for them and cataring to their needs then by all means go ahead and get them the things that they need. Sometimes when a craving becomes to strong it can overcome the love and affection that they have for you and they can become agressive. Another thing you could do to make them comfortable in their own skin is trying to encorporate some source of activity planner so that they know what to do during the day and when.
				In conclusion drugs affect opeople in different ways and can change your relationship with them durastically the best thing to do is to start small and work your way up. This may seem hard at first but once you realize their worth it it gets alot easier for the both of you. Try harder, support and become the best role model that perosn has ever had .
