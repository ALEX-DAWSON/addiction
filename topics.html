				<h2>What are some benefits of your child going to rehab?</h2>
				<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
				<p>
					I feel as though going to rehab will help your child have a better and happy life. When your child is suffering everyday, Your child will end up getting help from people that know what they are doing. Once your child is off all the drugs that they are doing they will feel a lot better about themselves and they will know what is going on in the moment that they are in. Some parents wonder why these things are happening to their child. Some peoples kids tend to struggle with depression during their teen years. Most kids will go to drugs to cover up their depression. Or they will do drugs because that's the way of feeling okay and safe. Some signs of depression are according to “WebMD” feeling guilt, worthless, loss of interest in doing things, not wanting to be around people, loss of remembering things, loss of sleep or sleeping too much.

				<h2>Can other drug addictions lead to other mental health disorders? </h2>
				<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
				<p>	Its abnormal for an addicted person to have other mental illnesses but it is unidentified weather the Mental health is caused by the addiction or not. It is also common that some genes in your family could contribute to the addiction. According to BBR foundation  “several studies show that in some cases marijuana and other drugs can produce psychotic symptoms similar to those experienced by people with schizophrenia.” Heavy use of drugs can lead to both long term and short term effects. People who are addicted to drugs can experience depression, anxiety and aggressive behaviors. Some of the top drugs that cause mental health problems are marijuana, cocaine and kratom. If your unaware, Kratom is a drug that alters your sense of reality and makes you think that things are real when they’re not.

				<h2>How do I get my kid to go to rehab?</h2>
				<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
				<p>
					Some positive things you can do to get your child to go to rehab could be telling them what will happen if they don’t go. For example, many people that don't go to get help could end up in jail, on the streets, and/or overdosing.
					I think if the person with the addiction talked to people that are in jail about their past and what they had to go through because of their addiction, then the person may not want to do the drug because they don't want their life to be like that. You could also tell them the benefits of going to rehab and encourage them to make the right choice.
					Another good thing you could do is get your child to talk to someone that has already been through an addiction that hasn't been in trouble with the law. That way, they can see what they may have to go through in the future if they don't go to rehab and get help, even if they didn't end up in jail.

				<h2>What do I do if my child goes into the stage of denial?</h2>
				<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
				<p>
					If your child doesn't think they have a problem and or doesn't think they need help, these are some things you can do.
					One thing that may be very effective is having a family meeting so everyone of the child's loved ones can tell them how they feel and why they feel that way. They can talk about how they might lose them to the child's use of drugs.
					The second thing that could help them stop or make them stop is telling them that if they don't get help they may have to move out.
					The last suggestion I have for you could be being very up front with them and brutally honest about the addiction and how much it is going to ruin their life. Say if they are going to continue using the drug that they are going to lose everyone because they don't want to see them going through that. Also tell the person if they are going to anyway, then everyone is going to be there to help the child get over the addiction.
