			<h1>Where To Find Help</h1>
			<h2>Amphetamines</h2>
			<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			<p>
				This section of our article will be based on a multitude of different options for treatment based on the side effects of each drug. The first drug I am going to be touching on in Amphetamines. Amphetamine is a very strong and pricey drug. From the research I've done I have noticed that some of the drugs are a little bit more costly than others. Side effects can lead to death, hallucinations and massive migraines. All of these side effects can be dealt with if you get help.For specifically Amphetamines some of the things you can do is do a detoxification. This means that you would almost be doing something similar to a food cleanse but with drugs. This is an extremely long and difficult process so if you're struggling with an addiction you need to be prepared that this won't happen instantly. Artemis states that the detox pathway is “Detoxification, or “detox” for short, is the body’s process of removing toxic substances. Detoxification is not a food, or diet, or a pill - it is an ongoing, VITAL process that your body does (all on its own) in order to survive. It happens 24/7, 365 days of the year. Not just for a few days or weeks prescribed to “do a detox”.Your main detoxification organs are the liver and kidneys. The bowels and urinary tract are extensions of these organs as wastes exit your body.”

			<h2>Hallucinogens</h2>
			<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			<p>
				Here there is a definite few steps you can take to be able to prevent further addiction and get help with your addiction. One of the main steps is to talk about treatment at CAMH with the person with the addiction. Do not make the decision yourself. As the person with the addiction could possible react and become aggressive, which is one of the side effects listed. If you are unable to convince the person with the addiction to go to treatment at CAMH or other programs to fit the specific needs of the person, try asking them what they need to be successful.

			<h2>Inhalants</h2>
			<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			<p>
				There are many different things that could qualify as an inhalant. Things like: ink, markers, paint and gasoline all are addictive chemicals once inhaled for a long period of time. For instance you might not mind the smell of gasoline but when directly inhaled there is a higher chance of you becoming addicted to that specific chemical. If you are unwilling to help yourself how are people supposed to help you? So I have come to give some simple solutions for when you're unwilling to be in treatment and stay in a treatment centre other than your own home .For one you need to accept the addiction and stop blaming others you need to take accountability for your actions .While this takes place you also need to remember that other people are there for you, you’re not alone! My personal opinion is that you try to get the help before it's too late. So go that one step further, don't hesitate to get the help you need. Io would say to go to a public group for people who struggle with addictions and meet people who you can encourage just like we've encouraged you
			</p>
			<h2>Cocaine</h2>
			<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
			<p>
				One thing that someone would do is go to therapy to go get help for their addictions to cocaine and the reason why I picked this one is because when they get there the people are learning life long skills and then they would help someone else in the future when they are all better. Most of the time people will go there during the day for maybe for the whole day and then they will come home at night and not be allowed out because they might have access to cocaine and they might get pressured into doing it by someone else. The reason why I picked this one is because I really think it would help someone because it has helped a lot of people. Someone who is talking therapy for their addiction to cocaine is one of the hardest things to do because when you are there then you will see everyone who is hooked on cocaine and seeing other people and how they are acting or how they look might trigger someone in you and you will just have a mental breakdown or you will end up running away from your problems. That is not a good thing to do so going to this therapy cushion and getting help even though you will be scared might be the best thing for you because it will help you now and in the long run.

			<h2>Cannabis</h2>
			<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
			<p>
				Cannabis is a very common drug and as this is a very well known one. People will often pay around $6.83 per gram. This is a lot for a little amount but cannabis is very easily burned and used quickly. “12 step/ community supports: outside of professional treatment options someone with marijuanna addiction can receive assistance from peer supports in the form of 12-step meetings and other community programs. These will provide recovery information for those with personal experience. Drug testing it can be found in urine test  four weeks after the last use. “These tests can act as strong deterrents, especially when incentives are given for Success”.”
			</p>
			<h2>Perscription Drugs</h2>
			<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
			<p>
				Some people who are taking prescription drugs don’t take it for the right things they  take it so they can get high off of it or they take it for a better feeling and they will take too many of them. Some people say they are taking them so they can feel better about themselves but not for the correct reasons. For someone to get help for that is to go talk to someone or to go to rehab to get help. The reason why someone should do that is because people can get hurt or they would get someone else to take their pills and then someone else can get hurt because they are not meant for their body. The reason why I picked someone to go to rehab for this is because they could get a lot of help for it and in the long run they will feel so much better about themselves and they will have a happy life not being on something that's really making them feel crappy they just don’t know that at the time. Someone who wants to abuse their prescription drug is not okay because they are putting their life at risk and they could overdose on it so I think it would be best if people went to rehab to get their lives figured out and so they could feel good about themselves and have a happy and better life.

			<h2>Alcohol</h2>
			<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
			<p>
				For places to go to get help, I chose going to support groups like AA and getting a therapist. I think going to Alcoholics Anonymous is the best decision for a person struggling with alcoholism because you get to talk to people that are going through the same thing as you or almost over coming the same addiction you have. This would be a good thing because then the person will know that they are not alone and will not be judged by anyone in the group. Everyone is going through the same thing. My second option would be going to a therapist because some people still aren't comfortable talking to a bunch of people about their addiction. They are either embarrassed or just a shy person and with a therapist you get a one on one and more personal experience. With a therapist you won't have to worry about someone telling others about your personal life.
			</p>
			<h2>Tobacco</h2>
			<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
			<p>
				For tobacco addictions, I said that a person can go to a therapist that specializes in addictions because then they will know how to help you quit and help you cope with the reason why you feel the need to go to this drug. My second option would be to go to a hospital where people have lung cancer and let them talk to the people because I’m sure when the person that has lung cancer talks to them, it will basically scare them into quitting because nobody would want to go through what they are going through.
			</p>
			<h2>Opioids</h2>
			<h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
			<p>
				 For opioid addictions, I said going to rehab and going to support groups. My first option that I think would be the best would be going to rehab because opioids are a hard thing to stop doing. Rehab will take you away from any access from any drugs and help you deal with any problems or reasons why you feel the need to do this drug. They will change your life for the better. My second option would be going to a support group because then you will get to meet people that are going through or have already gone through what you are going through and tell you how they overcame it. The group will give you people to talk to that understand what you are going through and know how hard it really is.
