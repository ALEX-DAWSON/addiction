			<h1>Side Effects</h1>
			<h2>Hallucinogens</h2>
			<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			<p>
				Here there is a definite few steps you can take to be able to prevent further addiction and get help with your addiction. One of the main steps is to talk about treatment at CAMH with the person with the addiction. Do not make the decision yourself. As the person with the addiction could possible react and become aggressive, which is one of the side effects listed. If you are unable to convince the person with the addiction to go to treatment at CAMH or other programs to fit the specific needs of the person, try asking them what they need to be successful.
			</p>
			<h2>Inhalants</h2>
			<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			<p>
				There are many different things that could qualify as an inhalant. Things like: ink, markers, paint and gasoline all are addictive chemicals once inhaled for a long period of time. For instance you might not mind the smell of gasoline but when directly inhaled there is a higher chance of you becoming addicted to that specific chemical. If you are unwilling to help yourself how are people supposed to help you? So I have come to give some simple solutions for when you're unwilling to be in treatment and stay in a treatment centre other than your own home .For one you need to accept the addiction and stop blaming others you need to take accountability for your actions .While this takes place you also need to remember that other people are there for you, you’re not alone! My personal opinion is that you try to get the help before it's too late. So go that one step further, don't hesitate to get the help you need. Io would say to go to a public group for people who struggle with addictions and meet people who you can encourage just like we've encouraged you
			</p>
			<h2>Cocaine</h2>
			<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
			<p>
				One thing that someone would do is go to therapy to go get help for their addictions to cocaine and the reason why I picked this one is because when they get there the people are learning life long skills and then they would help someone else in the future when they are all better. Most of the time people will go there during the day for maybe for the whole day and then they will come home at night and not be allowed out because they might have access to cocaine and they might get pressured into doing it by someone else. The reason why I picked this one is because I really think it would help someone because it has helped a lot of people. Someone who is talking therapy for their addiction to cocaine is one of the hardest things to do because when you are there then you will see everyone who is hooked on cocaine and seeing other people and how they are acting or how they look might trigger someone in you and you will just have a mental breakdown or you will end up running away from your problems. That is not a good thing to do so going to this therapy cushion and getting help even though you will be scared might be the best thing for you because it will help you now and in the long run.
			</p>
			<h2>Cannabis</h2>
			<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
			<p>
				Cannabis is a very common drug and as this is a very well known one. People will often pay around $6.83 per gram. This is a lot for a little amount but cannabis is very easily burned and used quickly. “12 step/ community supports: outside of professional treatment options someone with marijuanna addiction can receive assistance from peer supports in the form of 12-step meetings and other community programs. These will provide recovery information for those with personal experience. Drug testing it can be found in urine test  four weeks after the last use. “These tests can act as strong deterrents, especially when incentives are given for Success”.”
			</p>
			<h2>Perscription Drugs</h2>
			<h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
			<p>
				Some people who are taking prescription drugs don’t take it for the right things they  take it so they can get high off of it or they take it for a better feeling and they will take too many of them. Some people say they are taking them so they can feel better about themselves but not for the correct reasons. For someone to get help for that is to go talk to someone or to go to rehab to get help. The reason why someone should do that is because people can get hurt or they would get someone else to take their pills and then someone else can get hurt because they are not meant for their body. The reason why I picked someone to go to rehab for this is because they could get a lot of help for it and in the long run they will feel so much better about themselves and they will have a happy life not being on something that's really making them feel crappy they just don’t know that at the time. Someone who wants to abuse their prescription drug is not okay because they are putting their life at risk and they could overdose on it so I think it would be best if people went to rehab to get their lives figured out and so they could feel good about themselves and have a happy and better life.
			</p>
			<h2>Alcohol</h2>
			<h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
			<p>
				For places to go to get help, I chose going to support groups like AA and getting a therapist. I think going to Alcoholics Anonymous is the best decision for a person struggling with alcoholism because you get to talk to people that are going through the same thing as you or almost over coming the same addiction you have. This would be a good thing because then the person will know that they are not alone and will not be judged by anyone in the group. Everyone is going through the same thing. My second option would be going to a therapist because some people still aren't comfortable talking to a bunch of people about their addiction. They are either embarrassed or just a shy person and with a therapist you get a one on one and more personal experience. With a therapist you won't have to worry about someone telling others about your personal life.
			</p>
			<h2>Tobacco</h2>
			<h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
			<p>
				For tobacco addictions, I said that a person can go to a therapist that specializes in addictions because then they will know how to help you quit and help you cope with the reason why you feel the need to go to this drug. My second option would be to go to a hospital where people have lung cancer and let them talk to the people because I’m sure when the person that has lung cancer talks to them, it will basically scare them into quitting because nobody would want to go through what they are going through.
			</p>
			<h2>Opioids</h2>
			<h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
			<p>
				 For opioid addictions, I said going to rehab and going to support groups. My first option that I think would be the best would be going to rehab because opioids are a hard thing to stop doing. Rehab will take you away from any access from any drugs and help you deal with any problems or reasons why you feel the need to do this drug. They will change your life for the better. My second option would be going to a support group because then you will get to meet people that are going through or have already gone through what you are going through and tell you how they overcame it. The group will give you people to talk to that understand what you are going through and know how hard it really is.

			 <h1>Programs for Recovery</h1>
			 <h2>Rehab</h2>
			 <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
			 <p>
				 The program I will be doing is rehab. Rehab is not the type of program that you get a lot of sleep in. So a lot of the people will wake up early in the morning and then they will have a good and healthy breakfast to start their days off well. Rehab is the type of program that they will expect you to eat healthy. Then after people are done eating their healthy breakfast then they have morning class that they can do. Some of theses morning classes will be yoga or medication to help them start their morning off and to try and keep them calm during the day. After breakfast then they have a morning session that a counsellor is leading it and that will normally help if they wake up and they are having a hard time and then they will get to talk about their feelings before starting the day and so they don’t start the day off wrong. And this lesson will normally following in talking about their addiction to the drugs that they are taking. Theses programs are to help the people with additions to stay healthy and give them the opartody to get better and to feel better about themself.
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 In the afternoon, they will have a good and healthy lunch and then they will have another lesson that is called therapeutic lessons. This treatment is the most effective way to get people to talk about their addiction to drugs. After they are done talking about it then the counselor will give the people a better and healthier ideas to control the trigger that they get so they don’t turn to drugs. Then they will do family therapy. Normally family therapy will work because people that are addicted to drugs normally want to know that their families are there for them. And that is why most drug programs will have this in their programs. <a href="sources.html"><sup>19</sup></a>
			 </p>
			 <h2>Detox</h2>
			 <h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			 <p>
				 There are many programs to help you when you are addictedto drugs.They help you lean off of the current drug you are addicted to, and gives you facts on specifically what that drug does to your body.While I researched the many programs avaliable to the youth and adults there was one that specifically stood out to me. This program is called “The Neworld Medical Detox - Alcohol, Drug Rehabilitation & Treatment Centre in Toronto, GTA Ontario” This program offers many different soloutions and activites to help you understand better what drugs do to your system. As someone states on google review: “Score 15 out of 10!. Operations management: empathetic/non judgmental, confidential. I asked for a few items and they were granted. overall very professional and kind. general staffing: excellent. I was properly medically detoxed. I was fed very well.. I was more content here instead of home.” From the google reviews combined this treatment facitlity has a 4.9 star review out of 5. Personally I would want to be made to feel at home but some places dont nessecarily provide that feeling for individuals who struggle. I know for me being away from home can be difficult. But from thereview given this place is gives quite the homey vibe.
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 In this program they have “an upscale residential detox treatment facility located in beautiful Halton Hills, Ontario, Canada. We are conveniently located about 30 minutes away from Pearson Airport and about 50 minutes from Downtown Toronto.  We offer our detox programs to a small number of guests to ensure undivided attention and the care they deserve.”
				 This prgram supposedly provides some of the best service as the doctors are in 24/7 and the living environment is very positive. Speaking from being away from home for 2 years at a household in missisauga (Toronto) it is 100% anxiety provoking at first but it eventually gets better.
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 This is one of thee facilities in Toronto they state that they are the best facility and one that works:
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 “At the CHRC Addiction Treatment Centre, our approach is vastly different than that of traditional treatment models. We address addiction as both behavioural and biochemical in nature.Through research and working with leading experts in the field, it’s clear to us that the traditional psychological model and 12-step-based programs simply don’t work for a large percentage of people, as they do not address the biochemical imbalances, nutritional deficiencies and neurological conditions that underlie addictive behaviour. That is why CHRC should come as your top choice when looking for the best rehab facilities in Toronto.” <a href="sources.html"><sup>2</sup></a>

			 <h1>How to Stop Using</h1>
			 <h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			 <p>
				 Normally there is no specific and set soloution I would give to stop using drugs because everyones situation is different. But honestly there are a few simple steps to eliminating this from your current lifestyle. Now noramlly people sit down and tell you the most difficult things to do and try to accomplish while being a drug user. Honestly trying to quit while being a drug user is extremley hard and sometimes unreachable. But if you put your mind to it 100% you can accomplish it over time. Not instantly will this work but there is something called a 12 step recovery program that will get you those 12 steps closer to leaving your addiction behind. There are many ways you can begin completing  this process. One of which is being fully invested in this process...you need to accept that this process has to take place. There is always a way.
			 </p>
			 <p>
				  You never are really stuck until you give up. So take initative and start becoming the person you wish to be not who others wish you were. I understand that it's hard and that you may feel alone atr some point in your life it's bound to happen. During this process there are many quiestions you may have about the opption for treatment and the 12 step process.
				</p>

					As well MaryLand Recovery states “The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) reports that addicts show the most significant improvement about three months into treatment. Additionally, NIDA asserts that 90-day programs should be the new gold standard for successful treatment for substance use disorders.Every person is different and there is no magic number of days that cures everyone the same. However, recovery experts and statistics do insist that programs 90 days or longer are considerably more successful in helping patients maintain sobriety and see a lower risk of relapse.Longer time in rehab equates to more practice time on relapse-avoidance skills and other helpful“coping strategies.According to MaryLand Recovery “Although the results will be slightly different for everyone who goes through a 12-step program, this approach to recovery generally tends to help with:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Self-control
						</li>
						<li>
							Honesty
						</li>
						<li>
							Accountability
						</li>
						<li>
							Direction and structure
						</li>
						<li>
							Social interaction
						</li>
						<li>
							Making amends with those harmed
						</li>
						<li>
							Character building
						</li>
						<li>
							Willpower
						</li>
						<li>
							Overall health
						</li>
						<li>
							Reducing the chance of relapse
						</li>
						<li>
							Belief in a higher power and the greater good
						</li>
						<li>
							Spiritual, emotional and physical balance"	<a href="sources.html"><sup>11</sup></a>
						</li>
					</ul>

					The first reason of how people can stop using drugs is that you can go to rehab and there are a lot of people there that will help your addiction into stop doing the drugs that you are addicted to. The people there will do some group work and one on one work with you and give you some steps into getting rid of your addiction and to a better and healthy life. Another step into people stop doing drugs is to take care of your body well. With eating good with staying active and making sure that if you have a craving for a drug then start thinking about things that you can replace it with something else. According to MaryLand Recovery.“Traditional rehab for drug and alcohol addiction comes in the form of a 28-day or 30-day program. Programs typically include medically supervised detox, therapy and education on addiction and sobriety.Extended addiction treatment programs — 90 days or longer — are becoming more popular due to evidence-based studies showing relapse to be less likely the longer the patient is in formal rehab.Shorter programs are often less expensive, but long-term programs are better able to help people address the deep-seated roots of addiction in order to achieve long-term sobriety and avoidance of relapse. Therefore, a longer program could end up being more cost effective if it eliminates the patient’s need for return trips to rehab.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Another way that people can stop using drugs is According to MaryLand Recovery stats. “At Maryland Recovery, we offer recovery housing to give each patient stability and a substance-free environment during this extended time in rehab.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our programs allow patients to keep one foot in rehab and one foot in everyday life. For example, our intensive outpatient (IOP) and partial hospitalization program (PHP) formats allow people in recovery to hold down a job or continue their education while still in treatment. We encourage patients to stay in the area to complete treatment — and away from their former problematic environments – which is why recovery housing is encouraged” <a href="sources.html"><sup>6</sup></a>
