      <h1>Everyday Struggles of Teens With Addictions</h1>

      <p>
        There are many struggles teens have throughout their life .Around the age of 13-18 I have noticed that this is where teens struggle most. Sometimes I wonder if that going or transitioning into highschool plays a role in that. Maybe if we had a better idea of what this drug abuse was caused by. Whether it's the high school transition or something else. We need to get a better handle on these teens decisions.

        The National Institute on Drug Abuse states “Methamphetamine is a stimulant drug usually used as a white, bitter-tasting powder or a pill. Crystal methamphetamine is a form of the drug that looks like glass fragments or shiny, bluish-white rocks. It is chemically similar to amphetamine [a drug used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, a sleep disorder].” “Many hallucinogens have chemical structures similar to those of natural neurotransmitters (acetylcholine-, serotonin-, or catecholamine-like). The most commonly abused hallucinogens are: LSD. Mescaline.”

      <p>
        “Hallucinogens are a diverse group of drugs that alter a person’s awareness of their surroundings as well as their own thoughts and feelings. They are commonly split into two categories: classic hallucinogens (such as LSD) and dissociative drugs(such as PCP). Both types of hallucinogens can cause hallucinations, or sensations and images that seem real even though they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, dissociative drugs can cause users to feel out of control or disconnected from their body and environment.Some hallucinogens are extracted from plants or mushrooms, and some are synthetic (human-made). Historically, people have used hallucinogens for religious or healing rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, people report using these drugs for social or recreational purposes, including to have fun, deal with stress, have spiritual experiences, or just to feel different.Common classic hallucinogens include the following:LSD (D-lysergic acid diethylamide) is one of the most powerful mind-altering chemicals. It is a clear or white odorless material made from lysergic acid, which is found in a fungus that grows on rye and other grains. LSD has many other street names, including acid, blotter acid, dots, and mellow yellow.”
