      <h1>Withdrawal Symptoms</h1>
      <h2>Cocaine</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One withdrawal symptom of cocaine is slowed thinking and that normally happens because the brain is becoming slow and then when you try and talk and think about things you are slower than normal. Some other things are suicidal thoughts or actions the reason why this happens is because when you are on drugs you are not acting like yourself and then all your bad thoughts all gather up at once and then you are feeling bad about yourself and then you will want to commit suicied thoughts and you will not want to be here at all because your going to think that you don’t want to be here and you will also think that no one loves or cares about you so you will not want to be here.
      </p>
      <h2>Cannabis</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One withdrawal symptom for cannabis is memory loss that will happen because when your high it affects the brain and then you won’t remember  most stuff because the brain is not thinking right so that will make you forget a lot of stuff . Another one would be stomach pains because sometimes when you are high you will get the munchies and eat to much or someone when you are high you don’t eat at all and you can get stomach pain from that because you are pretty much starving yourself.
      </p>
      <h2>Perscription Drugs</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One withdrawal symptom of prescription drugs are muscle and bone paine and the reason why this could happen is because when you are on theses types of drugs they can mess with you bones and stuff like that or if you are not prescribed them then they can also mess with your body. Another ones would be Sweating, chills and  goosebumps the reason why this sometimes will happen is because your sending your body into shock and your body is not used to the drugs that are going into your body or you maybe putting too much of it in your body. Sometimes that will lead to overdosing.
