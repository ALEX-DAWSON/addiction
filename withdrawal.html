      <h1>Withdrawal Symptoms</h1>
      <h2>Cocaine</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One withdrawal symptom of cocaine is slowed thinking and that normally happens because the brain is becoming slow and then when you try and talk and think about things you are slower than normal. Some other things are suicidal thoughts or actions the reason why this happens is because when you are on drugs you are not acting like yourself and then all your bad thoughts all gather up at once and then you are feeling bad about yourself and then you will want to commit suicied thoughts and you will not want to be here at all because your going to think that you don’t want to be here and you will also think that no one loves or cares about you so you will not want to be here.
      </p>
      <h2>Cannabis</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One withdrawal symptom for cannabis is memory loss that will happen because when your high it affects the brain and then you won’t remember  most stuff because the brain is not thinking right so that will make you forget a lot of stuff . Another one would be stomach pains because sometimes when you are high you will get the munchies and eat to much or someone when you are high you don’t eat at all and you can get stomach pain from that because you are pretty much starving yourself.
      </p>
      <h2>Perscription Drugs</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One withdrawal symptom of prescription drugs are muscle and bone paine and the reason why this could happen is because when you are on theses types of drugs they can mess with you bones and stuff like that or if you are not prescribed them then they can also mess with your body. Another ones would be Sweating, chills and  goosebumps the reason why this sometimes will happen is because your sending your body into shock and your body is not used to the drugs that are going into your body or you maybe putting too much of it in your body. Sometimes that will lead to overdosing.

      <h2>Alcohol</h2>
      <h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
      <p>
        Some symptoms of withdrawals are headaches, heart palpitations, seizures, anxiety, confusion, and restlessness. Not all people have these symptoms, but it is most common for people to have them. These happen because when you drink alcohol frequently or heavily, it starts to slow down your brain. Then your body starts producing more chemicals and it starts to keep producing them, even when you are not drinking alcohol. Most of these symptoms happen because alcohol affects your dopamine. Dopamine regulates your energy and motivation
      </p>
      <h2>Tobacco</h2>
      <h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
      <p>
        Not everyone will experience nicotine withdrawals, but people that quit cold turkey will be affected the most. But if you slowly quit smoking, you will have less nicotine withdrawal. Some withdrawal symptoms are nicotine cravings, snacking and weight gain, sleep disturbance, persistent cough, flu like symptoms, and mood changes. Most people gain about 10 pounds when quitting tobacco because people tend to replace smoking with food. So whenever a person has a craving, they just eat something to make it go away or distract them from the craving. Most people think when they get a persistent cough then they are getting worse but this actually means your lungs are getting better and making you cough up the bad stuff in your lungs.
      </p>
      <h2>Opioids</h2>
      <h3>Jeffery Cove</h3>
      <p>
        Symptoms for opioid withdrawals include runny nose, teary eyes, restlessness, insomnia, uncontrollable yawning, excessive sweating, anxiety, and muscle spasms. Some more intense symptoms are rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, dilated pupils, perinioya, vomiting, and diarrhea. To help cope with these withdrawal symptoms you can take hot baths, exercise, yoga, do stuff that entertains you, and keep hydrated.
