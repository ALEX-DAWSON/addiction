      <!-- Article -->
      <h2>Cocaine</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One withdrawal symptom of cocaine is slowed thinking and that normally happens because the brain is becoming slow and then when you try and talk and think about things you are slower than normal. Some other things are suicidal thoughts or actions the reason why this happens is because when you are on drugs you are not acting like yourself and then all your bad thoughts all gather up at once and then you are feeling bad about yourself and then you will want to commit suicied thoughts and you will not want to be here at all because your going to think that you don’t want to be here and you will also think that no one loves or cares about you so you will not want to be here.

      <h2>Cannabis</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One withdrawal symptom for cannabis is memory loss that will happen because when your high it affects the brain and then you won’t remember  most stuff because the brain is not thinking right so that will make you forget a lot of stuff . Another one would be stomach pains because sometimes when you are high you will get the munchies and eat to much or someone when you are high you don’t eat at all and you can get stomach pain from that because you are pretty much starving yourself.

      <h2>Perscription Drugs</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One withdrawal symptom of prescription drugs are muscle and bone paine and the reason why this could happen is because when you are on theses types of drugs they can mess with you bones and stuff like that or if you are not prescribed them then they can also mess with your body. Another ones would be Sweating, chills and  goosebumps the reason why this sometimes will happen is because your sending your body into shock and your body is not used to the drugs that are going into your body or you maybe putting too much of it in your body.

      <h2>Alcohol</h2>
      <h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
      <p>
        Some symptoms of withdrawals are headaches, heart palpitations, seizures, anxiety, confusion, and restlessness. Not all people have these symptoms, but it is most common for people to have them. These happen because when you drink alcohol frequently or heavily, it starts to slow down your brain. Then your body starts producing more chemicals and it starts to keep producing them, even when you are not drinking alcohol. Most of these symptoms happen because alcohol affects your dopamine. Dopamine regulates your energy and motivation

      <h2>Tobacco</h2>
      <h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
      <p>
        Not everyone will experience nicotine withdrawals, but people that quit cold turkey will be affected the most. But if you slowly quit smoking, you will have less nicotine withdrawal. Some withdrawal symptoms are nicotine cravings, snacking and weight gain, sleep disturbance, persistent cough, flu like symptoms, and mood changes. Most people gain about 10 pounds when quitting tobacco because people tend to replace smoking with food. So whenever a person has a craving, they just eat something to make it go away or distract them from the craving. Most people think when they get a persistent cough then they are getting worse but this actually means your lungs are getting better and making you cough up the bad stuff in your lungs.

      <h2>Opioids</h2>
      <h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
      <p>
        Symptoms for opioid withdrawals include runny nose, teary eyes, restlessness, insomnia, uncontrollable yawning, excessive sweating, anxiety, and muscle spasms. Some more intense symptoms are rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, dilated pupils, perinioya, vomiting, and diarrhea. To help cope with these withdrawal symptoms you can take hot baths, exercise, yoga, do stuff that entertains you, and keep hydrated.

      <h1>Long and Short Term Effects</h1>
      <!-- Article -->
      <h2>Cocaine</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One long term effect for cocaine is high blood pressure, leading to heart attacks, strokes, and death the reason why this would happen is because when you get high from cocaine it is not just affecting your brain it is affecting all of your body. Since it is in your system it will be affecting your blood. And since your blood is important is will affect your heart and your heart will react to it not in a good way. One short term effect of this drug is loss of appetite. The reason why this would happen is because when you are high on cocaine there is something in it that makes you not want to eat. The reason for that is because the stuff that is in it is telling your body that you have already eaten and it is telling you that you are not hungry.

      <h2>Cannabis</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One short term effect of cannabis would be poor school performance and higher chance of dropping out. The reason why this would happen is because when you become a "stoner" all your going to want to do is hang out with your friends or stay at home and get high all day so your brain will tell you not to go to school. Then that would be a chance of you only showing up once in a while or dropping out of school which is not good. One short term effect would be you panicking. The reason why this would happen is because when you are high your body will be tripping out and you could be seeing things or hearing things and then that would mean your body would gop in panic mood.
      </p>

      <h2>Perscription Drugs</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One long term effect for prescription drugs would be your weight would be change. The reason why this could happen is because when you are taking drugs that you are not prescribed for then your body will react in a different way that it shouldn’t and it may just be that you 're losing more weight then you should be. One short term effect would be high body temperature. The reason why this could happen is because when you 're putting drugs into your system you are making your body do bad things and your body temperature would be going up or it could also be going down because your body is reacting in a bad way because of the bad things that you are putting in your body.

			<h2>Amphetamines</h2>
			<h3>Maya Kalan-McPhee</h3>
			<p>
				This section of our article will be based on a multitude of different options for treatment based on the side effects of each drug. The first drug I am going to be touching on in Amphetamines. Amphetamine is a very strong and pricey drug. From the research I've done I have noticed that some of the drugs are a little bit more costly than others. Side effects can lead to death, hallucinations and massive migraines. All of these side effects can be dealt with if you get help.For specifically Amphetamines some of the things you can do is do a detoxification. This means that you would almost be doing something similar to a food cleanse but with drugs. This is an extremely long and difficult process so if you're struggling with an addiction you need to be prepared that this won't happen instantly. Artemis states that the detox pathway is "Detoxification, or "detox" for short, is the body’s process of removing toxic substances. Detoxification is not a food, or diet, or a pill - it is an ongoing, VITAL process that your body does (all on its own) in order to survive. It happens 24/7, 365 days of the year. Not just for a few days or weeks prescribed to "do a detox".Your main detoxification organs are the liver and kidneys. The bowels and urinary tract are extensions of these organs as wastes exit your body."

			<h2>Alcohol</h2>
			<h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
			<p>
				one short term effect is blackouts( when the drinker can not remember anything that happened during the alcohol consumption). Alcohol starts to mess with your memory after about 2 drinks so when people start heavy drinking or chugging that's when people start to blackout .
			</p>
			<p>
				One long term effect is High blood pressure, stroke, and other heart-related diseases. This happens because when you drink it makes your blood pressure very high and if you are a constant heavy drinker it will start affecting your heart and that's what leads to High blood pressure, stroke, and other heart-related diseases
			</p>
			<h2>Tobacco</h2>
			<h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
			<p>
				A short term effect for tobacco is feelings of relaxed. This happens because the nicotine removes the uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms caused by smoking and causes a brief hit of dopamine.<a href="sources.html"><sup>17</sup></a>
			</p>
			<p>
				A long term effect from tobacco is cancer. Doctors believe that cancer happens because of the cell damage from the chemicals in the smoke. <a href="sources.html"><sup>9</sup></a>
			</p>
			<h2>Opioids</h2>
			<h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
			<p>
				a short term effect for opioids are a Mental fog. Ways you can work with this is going to a therapist and or a change in your life style could help fix your brain fog. <a href="sources.html"><sup>16</sup></a>
			</p>
			<p>
				A long term effect of opioids are Severe abdominal pain. This happens because opioids cause acid reflux and severe constipation. <a href="sources.html"><sup>13</sup></a>
