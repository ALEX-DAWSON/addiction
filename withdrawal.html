        One withdrawal symptom of cocaine is slowed thinking and that normally happens because the brain is becoming slow and then when you try and talk and think about things you are slower than normal. Some other things are suicidal thoughts or actions the reason why this happens is because when you are on drugs you are not acting like yourself and then all your bad thoughts all gather up at once and then you are feeling bad about yourself and then you will want to commit suicied thoughts and you will not want to be here at all because your going to think that you don’t want to be here and you will also think that no one loves or cares about you so you will not want to be here.

      <h2>Alcohol</h2>
      <h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
      <p>
        Some symptoms of withdrawals are headaches, heart palpitations, seizures, anxiety, confusion, and restlessness. Not all people have these symptoms, but it is most common for people to have them. These happen because when you drink alcohol frequently or heavily, it starts to slow down your brain. Then your body starts producing more chemicals and it starts to keep producing them, even when you are not drinking alcohol. Most of these symptoms happen because alcohol affects your dopamine. Dopamine regulates your energy and motivation

      <h2>Tobacco</h2>
      <h3>Jeffrey Cove</h3>
      <p>
        Not everyone will experience nicotine withdrawals, but people that quit cold turkey will be affected the most. But if you slowly quit smoking, you will have less nicotine withdrawal. Some withdrawal symptoms are nicotine cravings, snacking and weight gain, sleep disturbance, persistent cough, flu like symptoms, and mood changes. Most people gain about 10 pounds when quitting tobacco because people tend to replace smoking with food. So whenever a person has a craving, they just eat something to make it go away or distract them from the craving. Most people think when they get a persistent cough then they are getting worse but this actually means your lungs are getting better and making you cough up the bad stuff in your lungs.

      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One long term effect for cocaine is high blood pressure, leading to heart attacks, strokes, and death the reason why this would happen is because when you get high from cocaine it is not just affecting your brain it is affecting all of your body. Since it is in your system it will be affecting your blood. And since your blood is important is will affect your heart and your heart will react to it not in a good way. One short term effect of this drug is loss of appetite. The reason why this would happen is because when you are high on cocaine there is something in it that makes you not want to eat.

      <h2>Cannabis</h2>
      <h3>Nikita Beatty</h3>
      <p>
        One short term effect of cannabis would be poor school performance and higher chance of dropping out. The reason why this would happen is because when you become a “stoner” all your going to want to do is hang out with your friends or stay at home and get high all day so your brain will tell you not to go to school. Then that would be a chance of you only showing up once in a while or dropping out of school which is not good. One short term effect would be you panicking. The reason why this would happen is because when you are high your body will be tripping out and you could be seeing things or hearing things and then that would mean your body would gop in panic mood.
